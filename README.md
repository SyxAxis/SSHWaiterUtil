# SSHWaiterUtil
Simple util to wait for a remote file to appear, over SSH using priv key

More practice playing with Go. This is very simple util that reads a JSON config file that has some key connection details plus the file to be waited on.

Right now this is just a piece of educational code for example purposes only.
